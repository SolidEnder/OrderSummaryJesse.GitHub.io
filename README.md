Third Front End Mentor project. Will update as I go along to iron out some of the wrinkles.

The plan was supposed to have a colored box with a radius around it to kind of contrast it with the rest of the component, but other than that, so that's a little wrinkle in the
UI I'd like to work out. Other than that, as with the rest of my repo's I'm going to have to make sure they're all optimized for every browser, so expect updates on that.
